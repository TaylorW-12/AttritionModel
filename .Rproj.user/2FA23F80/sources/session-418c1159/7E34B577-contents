### Week 4 Exercise ----

# Our goal is to predict whether a penguin is male or female based on its characteristics.

### Set up ----

# load libraries
library(tidyverse) # tidyverse

library(broom) # to clean model outputs

library(GGally) # for pairs plots with ggplot

library(palmerpenguins) # for example 1

library(caret) # train/test splits and cross validation splits

library(pROC) # Sampling-over and under, ROC and AUC curve

library(margins) # for average marginal effects

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(90210)

### Load Data ----
data(penguins)

# Let's do a complete case analysis for simplicity
penguins <- penguins |>
  drop_na()

### Step 1: Create a train/test split ----
penguins_partition <- 
  createDataPartition(
    1:nrow(penguins), # no stratification
    p = 0.2
  )

penguins_train <- 
  penguins[-penguins_partition[[1]], ]

penguins_test <- 
  penguins[penguins_partition[[1]], ]

validate_partition <- 
  createDataPartition(
    1:nrow(penguins_train),
    p = 0.3
  )

penguins_validate <- 
  penguins_train[validate_partition[[1]], ]

penguins_train <- 
  penguins_train[-validate_partition[[1]], ]

### Step 2: Data Exploration ----

summary(penguins_train)

# correlations
# can use ggpairs on small data
# larger data means using subsets and/or manual calculation of stats
penguins_train |>
  select(
    - year,
  ) |>
  ggpairs(aes(color = sex, alpha = 0.5))


### Step 3: Data pre-processing ----
## Skipping for now. Going with complete case analysis

### Step 4: Feature Engineering ----
## Skipping for now. Mostly doing transformations in formulas, below.

### Step 5: Feature & Model Selection ----

# build a logistic regression model predicting sex
# include all variables in your data set except year

# summarize your model
f1<-glm(
    sex~.+
      I(species^2)+
      I(bill_length_mm^2)+
      I(bill_depth_mm^2)+
      I(flipper_length_mm^2)+
      I(body_mass_g^2)+
    island,
    data = penguins_train |>
      
    )
    family = binomial("logit")



# Get the in-sample AUC



# use stepwise regression with direction = "both" to select variables automatically

# get the in-sample AUC

# which model works better?

### Step 6: Model Evaluation ----

# plot a ROC curve and get AUC of both models above
# which is better?

# Choose the model you think is better
# get that model's marginal effects on the odds
# get that model's approximate marginal effects on the probabilities

# pick the variable with the highest marginal effect of both odds and probabilities
# Are they the same variable?
# For each, write a sentence in English describing how that/those variable(s)
# affect the odds/probability of predicting a penguin's sex



### Step 7: Predictions and Conclusions ----
